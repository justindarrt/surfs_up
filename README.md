# surfs_up

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather data in Hawaii and decide if it makes sense to open a surf/ice cream shop on the beach. We want to make sure the weather is decent year-round from a temperature and precipitation perspective. For this challenge we analyze the months of June and December. The source of the data is SQLLITE, and we use python sqlalchemy and pandas modules.
